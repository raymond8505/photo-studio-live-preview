# Why, tho?

I couldn't find a satisfactory solution online and thought it would be a fun project.

# What do?!

Watches a directory for new jpgs, displays them in real time in a simple React gallery.

# Ok, but how?

1. clone repo / download zip
2. install packages
3. rename `server/example.ENV` to `.ENV`
4. in `.ENV` set `WATCH_DIR` to your desired directory
5. `yarn client` and `yarn server` in seperate terminals
6. go to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser
